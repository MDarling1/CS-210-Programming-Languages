#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project's purpose was to create a small program that would allow one to display both a 12 hour formatted clock, and a 24 hour formatted clock. The ability to change the hour, minute, and second was required, while making sure the time was still displayed correctly.
  
#What did you do particularly well?
  I felt that considering the requirements of the project and the fact that it was the first project within three weeks of actually starting to learn C++, I did pretty well on all accounts.
  
#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  Looking back now, I realize there was a lot that could have gone wrong (and did go wrong while I was writing the code), including a header file would have been helpful and I feel I could have simplified my code a bit, even creating a constant variable for the different measurements of time might have helped.
  
#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  One of the problems I did run into was getting the time to update at all. I looked through tutorials on youtube and tried to find references, but to no avail. As a last ditch effort, I joined the SNHU discord server and asked questions there. I ended up making a friend who had dabbled in C++ for over 20 years and he was able to help me figure out that what I had needed was a form of connection to make the addition of time to update.
  
#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Learning the syntax was definitely helpful, though specifically this project mostly I felt like I had learned these skills from my previous Python and Java classes.
  
#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  When creating this program, I did my best to make it so that variables could be easily changed. I tried to explain parts of code with my inline comments, and I like to add my own touch with seperators between functions which I realize is completely unnecessary, but it helps in visibility for me.
